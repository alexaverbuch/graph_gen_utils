graph_gen_utils is a Maven project, built in Eclipse.

It's a helper library designed to quickly create and populate a Neo4j database instance.
Input graph files must be text files, encoded in the Chaco (often *.graph) ﬁle input format [1].
Input colouring/partitioning files are often *.ptn ﬁles.

Example files can be found in graphs/ and partitionings/ folders.

Data is inserted using Neo4j's BatchInserter in 2 passes.
1st pass - read complete Chaco file (and .ptn file), insert vertices into Neo4j, and index vertices using Lucene
2nd pass - read complete Chaco file again, insert edges into Neo4j, and index edges using Lucene

Functionality:
	-> Create Neo4j instance from Chaco (.graph) file
	-> Create "coloured" Neo4j instance from Chaco (.graph) file and partition (.ptn) files
	-> Create Chaco file frmo Neo4j instance [partially working...]

Example Usage:
	// Create NeoFromFile and assign DB location
	NeoFromFile neoCreator = new NeoFromFile("var/test11");

	// To generate uncoloured/unpartitioned neo4j graph
	//	* Assign input Chaco graph file
	neoCreator.generateNeo("graphs/test11.graph");

	// To generate coloured/partitioned neo4j graph
	//	* Assign input Chaco graph file & input partitioning file
	neoCreator.generateNeo("graphs/test11.graph","partitionings/test11.2.ptn");

	// To generate a Chaco file from DB instance
	//	* Assign output Chaco graph file & Chaco format
	neoCreator.generateChaco("graphs/test11-gen.graph",ChacoType.UNWEIGHTED);


Pre-alpha status...
- Using NeoClipse it has been visually tested for correctness when loading graphs of 5 vertices and 10 edges
  But no other testing has been performed yet
- It has had minimal performance tests on Chaco graphs files of approx: 42mb - 450,000 vertices - 3,500,000 edges

To do:
- Improve performance further
- Generate Chaco file from Neo4j instance (currently only supports generating Neo4j from file) [in progress...]
- Add verification functionality to test if generated graphs are correct
- Compare other graph metrics
